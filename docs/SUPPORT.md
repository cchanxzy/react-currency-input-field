# Support React Currency Input Field

## A Personal Note from the Maintainer

Hi, I’m Chun, the sole maintainer of **React Currency Input Field**. I started this project as a junior/mid-level developer, and it’s been an exciting journey to see it grow and be used by so many people.

Over time, as both the project and I have matured, my professional and personal responsibilities have increased. Balancing a full-time development job with maintaining this project has become challenging, especially when it comes to finding both the time and the mental energy.

These days, my schedule rarely allows me to contribute as extensively as I once did. When I do find free time, I’m often drawn to exploring and building new projects — something I’m sure many developers can relate to.

That said, I remain committed to keeping this project available under the MIT license. It’s a utility component that may seem small, but it provides significant functionality, saving countless hours for developers who’d otherwise have to build it from scratch.

## Why Support This Project?

This project sits in what I call **Goldilocks territory** — it’s popular enough to be widely used and relied upon, with an average of **800k downloads per month**, but not quite recognized enough to attract regular contributors or sponsorships.

Despite its popularity, maintaining the project falls solely on my shoulders. I’ve worked hard to ensure it remains **efficient, lightweight, and reliable**, but sustaining this effort alone has its challenges. In nearly **six** years, I’ve received only **one** sponsorship contribution.

Another misconception about open-source work is that, while maintaining this project has significantly improved my skills, it doesn’t always translate into career benefits. Interviewers rarely bring it up, and I still go through the same technical screenings as any other candidate. Open-source work is a labor of love, often undervalued despite its impact.

If this package has saved you or your team time and effort, consider supporting it as a way to show appreciation for the time and dedication that went into its development.
